There's so much amazing advice floating around on social media.
However, by its very nature social media is fleeting; stories travel
around on retweets, almost like an oral tradition.

I used to record these pieces of advice in my private notes, but then
I thought why not share them with the world? So, like a kind of
anthropologist, I've taken it upon myself to try to capture these oral
traditions in a place where they're easily accessible by everybody.
